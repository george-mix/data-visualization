It has the largest actual and inflation-adjusted box office receipts ($1,108.6 and $943.5 million respectively) and is in the top 3 films in terms of profit (in this article, profit is box office minus budget, which is not entirely correct, but I did not find more detailed data on profit).",
      "second-paragraph": "In addition to Skyfall, 1965's Thunderball and 1964's Goldfinger are in the top three, with 2005-adjusted box office receipts of $848.1 million and $820.4 million, respectively. Their estimated adjusted earnings were even slightly higher than Skyfall's, but since the earnings are \"estimated\" I thought it would be fair if popularity was decided according to the box office.",
      "third-paragraph": "If we talk about the most unsuccessful films of the franchise, then there are two of them: \"Casino Royale\" in 1967 and \"License to Kill\" in 1989. But they weren't flops either. Each managed to collect about $ 190 million in profits adjusted for 2005, which is not bad at all."
